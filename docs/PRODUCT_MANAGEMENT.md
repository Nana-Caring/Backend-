```

```bash
# Add sample products to database
node scripts/seedProducts.js
```

### 3. Test the API
```bash
# Test all endpoints
node test-products-api.js
```

## üì± Frontend Integration

Your React frontend can now display products by category matching dependent accounts:

```javascript
// Fetch Healthcare products
const healthcareProducts = await fetch('/api/products/category/Healthcare');

// Search for products
const searchResults = await fetch('/api/products?search=vitamins&category=Healthcare');

// Get product details for your ProductDetail component
const product = await fetch(`/api/products/${productId}`);
```

## üîß Admin Panel Integration

The admin routes are already integrated into your existing admin system at `/admin/products/*`. Admins can:

1. **View All Products** - See all products including inactive ones
2. **Add New Products** - Create products for specific categories
3. **Edit Products** - Update product information
4. **Manage Stock** - Update stock quantities and availability
5. **View Statistics** - See product performance by category

## üè™ Category-Account Mapping

Products are designed to work with your dependent account structure:

- **Education Account** ‚Üí Education category products (books, calculators, etc.)
- **Healthcare Account** ‚Üí Healthcare category products (medicine, supplements, etc.)
- **Transport Account** ‚Üí Transport category products (bus passes, fuel, etc.)

This allows parents/caregivers to:
1. Fund specific account types
2. Restrict purchases to relevant categories
3. Track spending by category
4. Ensure funds are used appropriately

## üìä Example Usage

```javascript
// Get all healthcare products for healthcare account spending
const healthcareProducts = await fetch('/api/products/category/Healthcare');

// Search for educational materials
const educationBooks = await fetch('/api/products?category=Education&search=mathematics');

// Get product details for purchase
const productDetails = await fetch('/api/products/123');
```

The system is now ready to support category-based product management that aligns with your dependent account structure!
