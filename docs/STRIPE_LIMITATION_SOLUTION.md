# üö® STRIPE PAYMENT METHOD LIMITATION - SOLUTION GUIDE

## **The Problem**
You encountered this error when testing money transfers:
```
"No such PaymentMethod: 'pm_test_1752094978590_4444'"
```

## **Root Cause**
Cards added via the **TEST endpoint** (`/api/payment-cards/add-test`) create mock payment method IDs that **DO NOT exist in Stripe**. These mock cards cannot be used for:
- Creating payment intents
- Processing actual payments
- Money transfers
- Any real Stripe operations

## **The Solution**

### **‚úÖ Use Official Stripe Test Payment Methods**

Instead of using the test endpoint, use the **production endpoint** with official Stripe test payment methods:

```bash
POST /api/payment-cards/add
Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "payment_method_id": "pm_card_visa",
    "user_id": 1,
    "is_default": true
}
```

### **Available Stripe Test Payment Methods:**
- `pm_card_visa` - Visa test card (‚úÖ Works with all operations)
- `pm_card_mastercard` - MasterCard test card
- `pm_card_amex` - American Express test card
- `pm_card_discover` - Discover test card

## **Quick Setup**

### **Option 1: Automated Script** (Recommended)
```bash
node add-stripe-test-cards.js
```
This script will:
1. Authenticate your user
2. Add 3 official Stripe test cards
3. Verify they were added correctly
4. Provide card IDs for testing transfers

### **Option 2: Manual Postman/cURL**
1. **Login** to get your auth token
2. **Add cards** using the production endpoint with Stripe test payment methods
3. **Test transfers** using the real card IDs

## **Updated Workflow**

### **For UI Development/Testing:**
```bash
POST /api/payment-cards/add-test
```
- ‚úÖ Good for: Card listing, UI testing, interface development
- ‚ùå Cannot be used for: Payments, transfers, Stripe operations

### **For Payment/Transfer Testing:**
```bash
POST /api/payment-cards/add
```
- ‚úÖ Works with: All operations including transfers and payments
- üìã Required: Official Stripe test payment methods

## **Testing Money Transfers**

Once you have real Stripe test cards added:

```bash
POST /api/transfers/send-to-beneficiary
Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "cardId": "{{REAL_CARD_ID}}",
    "beneficiaryId": 12,
    "amount": 500.00,
    "description": "Monthly allowance"
}
```

## **Updated Documentation**

All documentation has been updated to reflect this limitation:
- ‚úÖ `CREDIT_CARD_MANAGEMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Added warning at top
- ‚úÖ `TRANSFER_API_TEST_DATA.md` - Added Stripe limitation section  
- ‚úÖ `POSTMAN_TEST_DATA.md` - Updated solution section
- ‚úÖ `add-stripe-test-cards.js` - Quick setup script

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **TEST endpoint** = UI testing only (mock data)
2. **Production endpoint** = All operations (real Stripe integration)
3. **Always use official Stripe test payment methods** for payment testing
4. **Run the setup script** for quick test card addition
5. **Test transfers only work with real Stripe payment methods**
