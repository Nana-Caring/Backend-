- ✅ Removed `'Savings'` from `subAccountTypes` array
- ✅ Removed savings account balance mirroring logic
- ✅ Updated comments to remove savings account references

**Before:**
```javascript
const subAccountTypes = ['Education', 'Healthcare', 'Clothing', 'Entertainment','Baby Care','Pregnancy' ,'Savings' ];

// Mirror savings balance to main account
const savingsAccount = subAccounts.find(acc => acc.accountType === 'Savings');
if (savingsAccount) {
  mainAccount.balance = savingsAccount.balance;
  await mainAccount.save();
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const subAccountTypes = ['Education', 'Healthcare', 'Clothing', 'Entertainment','Baby Care','Pregnancy'];
// Removed savings account mirroring logic entirely
```

### **2. Transfer Controller** (`controllers/transferController.js`)
- ✅ Removed `'Savings': 20%` from distribution percentages

  'Education': 25,      // 25%
  'Healthcare': 20,     // 20%
  'Savings': 20,        // 20%  ← REMOVED
  'Clothing': 15,       // 15%
  'Baby Care': 10,      // 10%
  'Entertainment': 5,   // 5%
  'Pregnancy': 5        // 5%
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const DEFAULT_SUB_ACCOUNT_ALLOCATIONS = {
  'Healthcare': 25,     // 25% - Medical needs (highest priority)
  'Education': 20,      // 20% - Learning & development
  'Clothing': 20,       // 20% - Personal items (increased from 15%)

## 📊 **Updated Distribution Logic with Emergency Fund**

### **🚨 Emergency Fund Feature Added:**
**Main Account Emergency Fund:** 20% of all transfers remain in the Main account as accessible emergency savings

### **New Distribution Model:**
```
💰 Transfer Example: ZAR 100
├── 🚨 Emergency Fund (Main Account): ZAR 20 (20%)
└── 📊 Category Distribution: ZAR 80 (80%)
    ├── Healthcare: ZAR 20 (20% of transfer, 25% of distribution)
    ├── Groceries: ZAR 16 (16% of transfer, 20% of distribution)
    ├── Education: ZAR 16 (16% of transfer, 20% of distribution)
    ├── Transport: ZAR 8 (8% of transfer, 10% of distribution)
    ├── Pregnancy: ZAR 8 (8% of transfer, 10% of distribution)
    ├── Entertainment: ZAR 4 (4% of transfer, 5% of distribution)
    ├── Clothing: ZAR 4 (4% of transfer, 5% of distribution)
    └── Baby Care: ZAR 4 (4% of transfer, 5% of distribution)
```

### **Category Allocation (80% of Transfer):**
| Category | % of Transfer | % of Distribution | Priority |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Healthcare | **20%** | **25%** | 🔴 Critical |
| Groceries | **16%** | **20%** | 🔴 Critical |
| Education | **16%** | **20%** | 🟡 High |
| Transport | **8%** | **10%** | 🟡 Medium |
| Pregnancy | **8%** | **10%** | 🟡 Medium |
| Entertainment | **4%** | **5%** | 🟢 Low |
| Clothing | **4%** | **5%** | 🟢 Low |
| Baby Care | **4%** | **5%** | 🟢 Low |
| **Emergency Fund** | **20%** | **N/A** | 🚨 Always Available |

## � **Emergency Fund Implementation**

### **How It Works:**
1. **Funder Transfer** → ZAR 100 sent to Main account
2. **Emergency Fund** → ZAR 20 (20%) stays in Main account 
3. **Auto-Distribution** → ZAR 80 (80%) distributed to categories
4. **Emergency Access** → Dependent can withdraw from Main account anytime

### **Main Account Balance Logic:**
```javascript
// Example: ZAR 100 transfer
transferAmount = 100;
emergencyFund = transferAmount * 0.20;     // ZAR 20
distributionAmount = transferAmount * 0.80; // ZAR 80

// After distribution:
mainAccount.balance = emergencyFund;       // ZAR 20 (emergency fund)
// Categories get their allocated portions from distributionAmount
```

### **Emergency Fund Advantages:**
- **🚨 Immediate Access** - No category restrictions for emergencies
- **💡 Automatic Savings** - 20% of every transfer becomes emergency fund
- **🛡️ Financial Security** - Always have backup funds available
- **🎯 Balanced Approach** - Budgeting + Emergency preparedness
- **📱 User-Friendly** - Main account shows available emergency balance

## �🚀 **API Changes**

### **Account Types Available for Transfer:**
```javascript
// Valid accountType values for /api/funder/transfer
[
  "Main",        // Auto-distribution trigger
  "Healthcare",  // Direct medical expenses

  "Clothing",    // Direct clothing expenses
